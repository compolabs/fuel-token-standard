# Fuel network Fungible token standard: SWAY-GANG-TOKEN
## INTRODUCTION

### What is a Token?

Tokens can represent virtually anything in Fuel ⚡️:

- reputation points in an online platform
- skills of a character in a game
- lottery tickets
- financial assets like a share in a company
- a fiat currency like USD
- an ounce of gold
- and more...

Such a powerful feature of Fuel must be handled by a robust standard, right? That's exactly where the SWAY-GANG-TOKEN plays its role! This standard allows developers to build token applications that are interoperable with other products and services.

### What is ERC-20?

The SWAY-GANG-TOKEN introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token. For example, a SWAY-GANG-TOKEN Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.

## BODY

The SWAY-GANG-TOKEN, proposed by the SWAY GANG TEAM on December 2022, is a Token Standard that implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.

Example functionalities SWAY-GANG-TOKEN provides:

- transfer tokens from one account to another
- get the current token balance of an account
- get the total supply of the token available on the network *(soon)*
- approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a third-party account

If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an SWAY-GANG-TOKEN Contract and, once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens on Fuel.
